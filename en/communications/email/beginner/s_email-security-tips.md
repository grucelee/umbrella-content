# Use less email. 

Be aware of what you write and what would happen if it fell into the wrong hands. If in doubt, don't email it. [Sending a message](umbrella://communications/sending-a-message) is more secure. 

## Protect your accounts

Use [strong passwords](umbrella://information/passwords/beginner) and [2FA.](umbrella://information/passwords/advanced)

## Use up-to-date anti-virus software. 

Email security will not protect you if spyware on your device can record what your type. Don't ignore security warnings in your browser or webmail. (Learn to prevent [malware](umbrella://information/malware).)

## Don't click on unexpected links or attachments. 

Learn to spot [phishing](umbrella://communications/phishing).

## Use a pseudonym. 

Create an account that doesn't reveal your identity with a secure provider. Use it to communicate anonymously or post on public forums.

## Use multiple accounts.

Use different acccounts to communicate with different people. This protects your contact network and shields your identity when you sign up for Internet services that require email accounts.

## Use single-use email. 

One-time email address providers like [Mailinator](https://www.mailinator.com/) and [Guerillamail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/) do not require registration. Invent your own email address using the providerâ€™s extension and use it for short term needs like WiFi registration. (Inboxes are public so don't exchange sensitive information.)

## Use a code system.

Use code words instead of sensitive names and locations. Agree code words with email recipients in advance. 

## Use the Tor browser.

Anonymity software like the Tor browser helps you hide your email service from anyone who might be monitoring your Internet connection.
