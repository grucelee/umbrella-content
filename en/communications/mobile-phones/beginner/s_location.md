# Your phone broadcasts your location all day and all night. 

Mobile phones send automatic, regular location signals to service providers. 

## Apps, WI-FI and Bluetooth signals also identify your device or location. 

Many apps use your GPS location to help them provide services, or to collect data for their own use. 

# Where you are and *who* you are 

Your location may reveal: 

*	Habits and activities; 
*	Beliefs; 
*	Political participation; 
*	Personal relationships. 

## Turn off GPS 

* 	Turn on your GPS only when you need it;
*	Only give location permissions to apps that you trust and that have a good reason to know where you are.
