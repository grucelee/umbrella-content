title: Hate speech
---
Hate speech is an inexact term, but UN defines it as “any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor.”

Hate speech may be written, spoken or visual.

Examples include:

*	Speech that trivialises, glorifies or incites violence against women. 
*	Speech that trivialises the Holocaust. 
*	Speech that glorifies attacks on people because of their race.

Use of the term hate speech may overlap with trolling. Trolls post obscene or inflammatory comments to destabilise debate or attack someone.

[Online Abuse expert](umbrella://communications/online-abuse/expert) outlines other examples of online abuse. Abuse and hate speech take many forms, so read both lessons to understand the threats people face in online communities.

## Hate speech is not free speech

*	People of all backgrounds have a right to use their voices and to express themselves however they want. Hate speech is a violation of this right. 

*	Many of the same people committing such violence are very vocal about their own right to free speech, ignoring how their attacks restrict the free speech of others. 

*	Freedom of expression does not trump freedom from violence. If abuse is expressed in a particularly aggressive, inflammatory or sustained manner, then it may be considered hate speech.
