title: Discrimination and torture
---
Women, people with disabilities, people with mental healthcare needs, foreign nationals, ethnic and racial minorities, Indigenous peoples, and LGBTQI people are particularly vulnerable to ill treatment
and torture in detention. 

"Power imbalances and social or 
cultural attitudes or beliefs are most often intensified in
closed environments." 

- PRI/APT, "Women in detention: a guide to gender-sensitive monitoring," 2015.  

# Threats

## Sexual violence

- People in prison may be subject to rape to elicit 
confessions, to humiliate and dehumanise them, or because 
they are powerless. 
- Prisoners may be forced to
provide sex in return for basic rights, goods or privileges. 
- Sexual abuse by other prisoners may take
place, sometimes with the complicity of prison guards. 
- Sexual violence or custodial violence may include insults and humiliations of a sexual nature. 
- Male staff should not generally supervise female detainees, but this rule is not applied
in many countries, and female staff do also abuse women prisoners. 

*Developing a rapport with guards may reduce your risk of assault.*

## Solitary confinement

Solitary confinement can have harmful psychological and physiological effects. 

## Restraint

Being restrained is humiliating, especially if restraints are used unjustifiably or for prolonged periods.

# Times when you may be more at risk

Detainees are at heightened risk of torture or ill treatment during certain periods of time or procedures. 

## Admission

- During the period immediately after arrest, you are more likely to be pressurised to confess or provide
information. 

## Transit

- During transit between institutions there are usually few, if any, safeguards against abuse and prisoners may be totally unprotected. 

*Women are at heightened risk of sexual abuse where male and female prisoners are not
separated or where female prisoners are transported by male staff.*  

## Search or examination

Being searched or examined can be extremely humiliating and even traumatising, especially if
undertaken by the opposite sex. 

- Women should request a female official, doctor, or chaperone during search or examination. 

*Medical screening on entry to prison should aim to assess healthcare needs and detect ill treatment and torture. Other forms of examination, like virginity tests undertaken in some countries, represent a
gross form of discrimination against women and are considered to be a form of custodial violence.*
