## Possible psychological responses

* Dissociation: it is as if the victim is watching a film and experiences it as
an observer.
* Denial: ‘this is not happening to me’.
* Suppression: ‘it will be over in a few minutes; this isn’t the end of the world’.
* Rationalisation: ‘what a cheap way of satisfying your need to feel power.
You can’t really hurt me’.

*While these are healthy defence mechanisms during an attack they should not mislead
the victim into believing that she/he has not been deeply hurt.*

## Possible physical responses

* Vomiting, diarrhoea, hyperventilating, choking or having difficulty swallowing one’s saliva, losing consciousness and disorientation. 

These are normal reactions to the psychological and physical
experience of sexual assault.
