Sexual assaults are commonly under-reported due to feelings of shame and fear of others' reactions. 

Team members may want to encourage silence out of sensitivity to the victim’s feelings, their own
discomfort with the subject, or because they know the attacker. 

But failure to report a sexual assault may deprive the victim of essential treatment and put others at risk of becoming victims. 

## Reporting the incident to the police

The question of whether or not to inform the police is sensitive and should be the victim's choice.

*	Seek out a reliable and experienced lawyer. Ask the embassy if you are in another country. 
*	Learn about the procedures and time limits for reporting the crime to the police. 
*	The victim may need official documentation like a police report if she/he decides to initiate prosecution of the attacker, to access legal abortion services or to obtain HIV treatment at an affordable price.
* 	It is not uncommon for the victim to suffer a second trauma as a result of
insensitive treatment by the police.

## Support

A well-informed team member that the victim trusts should accompany them to the police station, to:  

*	Ensure that they are not intimidated or further victimised;
*  That interviews are conducted in a language that the victim understands;
*  That the appropriate documentation and assistance are provided.

It may help for the supporter to stress their official capacity if they are attached to an organisation. 

*Intervene if the victim’s rights and dignity are not respected.*

## Prosecution

*	If legal proceedings are desired, prosecution would be in the country where the assault occurred.
*	The decision to prosecute should be made by the victim;
*	The victim should be in a position to make an informed choice. 

Understand the practical details of an arrest and court
proceedings. Someone competent and objective should review the information with the victim. 

*	Will the victim have to identify a suspect before he can be
charged? How does this happen in practice? 
*	 Can a suspect be released on bail? 
*	Does the victim have to testify in court, possibly in front of the assailant?
* 	Can the prosecution proceed if the victim relocates or is overseas? 
*  	What are the penalties if the assailant is convicted? 
*   Given the facts of the case, what are the chances of conviction? 
*   What is the country’s record with regard to
international human rights standards and prosecution of sexual assault? 
*	Are
the courts predisposed to dismiss sexual assault or rape cases? 
*	What are the security implications of prosecuting? Will the victim be exposed to further threats? 
* 	What are the security implications of failing to prosecute?
