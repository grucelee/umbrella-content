title: Identify your weaknesses
---
### Adapt your plans based on security weaknesses.

To identify weaknesses, consider the spaces (physical and virtual) and people involved. 

## Spaces

Ask these questions when securing your workplace, or assessing the security of a space you use frequently. 

* Is access limited for unauthorised people or vehicles? 
* How are visitors' identification and motives verified? 
* How are visitors registered and monitored? Could an adversary use this to access sensitive information?  
* Are people or deliveries searched? 
* Are mail and packages isolated?
* Are glass windows laminated, toughened, or protected with anti-shatter or blast film? 
* Do you trust the people responsible for maintenance, cleaning, IT and security?  
* Is there an intercom for announcements? 
* Are people using the network trained in digital threats like malware and phishing? 

(Learn about [malware](umbrella://information/malware/beginner) and [phishing](umbrella://communications/phishing/beginner).)

* Is the space clean? Would it be easy to hide a malicious package? 
* Are unidentified or unaccompanied visitors challenged?  
* Are unused spaces locked? 
* Are there adequate locks and security alarms? 
* Are there smoke alarms and fire extinguishers or hoses?  
* Are security measures visible enough to deter attackers? 
* Do security measures increase during times of high traffic or high threat? 
* Is there a secure space you could shelter in or lockdown in a crisis?

### Save time in a crisis by clarifying roles and a chain of command in advance. 

## People

* Do the relevant people know where to go and what to do in specific emergency situations? 
* Who would be on a crisis team? 
* Who knows the site and the team and can coordinate with emergency responders? 
* Who has the skill and authority to make decisions in a crisis? 
* Who could replace someone else on the crisis team? 
* Who will assess whether a threat is genuine? What information or training do they need?
