Local authorities may include government officials, ministries, security forces, the military, and law enforcment agencies. 

## Communicate 

* Approach authorities before you start work.

Making first contact may diffuse suspicion and promote cooperation.

* Consult regularly. 

Including authorities in the process as you develop projects  provides them with the chance to take ownership of the results you advocate for, and may increase their support.

* Have a clear goal for every meeting. 

Indicate what you expect from them, and the benefits if they comply. Provide clear and specific action points.

## Build relationships

* Contact authorities as together with others on your team, not alone. 

Consider creating networks to advocate with authorities. 

* Check that all verbal and written communication you send will appear impartial. 

* Find ways to build trust and personal connections with individuals in authority. 

Depending on your context, this may include talking about family matters or sharing a meal.

*Note: in some areas, this strategy may undermine your work because other people think you are too close to the authorities. Use your judgement and be transparent.*

* Do your research

Learn about an agency's chain of command, interests, and public representatives before you engage.  

*Be aware that agencies and individuals have weaknesses that may limit your effectiveness unless you understand them and find ways to work with or around them.*  
 
## Educate

* Create practical, reader-friendly resources to describe international and national human rights standards.

Make sure that every official understands the standards that you are upholding and why. Lower ranking officials who understand the issues may be able to advocate internally on your behalf.

## Increase pressure

* Join regional and international networks. 

Choose or learn from existing networks that have proven to be effective.

* Seek visibility from international groups. 

Consider whether increasing publicity or international campaigns are likely to improve security, or undermine it.  

* Choose your moment. 

Consider political dynamics when developing strategy and decide on the best time to increase pressure.
